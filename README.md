# FE-configuration-generator
This project provides a utility to convert ID codes from VNR (Rusolut) to FE (Flash Extractor) when FE lacks the ID in its database. It extracts the ID from VNR and integrates it into the FE configuration, allowing Flash Extractor to process chips with IDs missing in its database.
